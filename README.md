# First Little Steps in Web Development: Static Website üåê

Welcome to my **first-ever website**! This project was crafted as part of my midterm project in the first term of my first year in college. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this website is a product of countless hours of online research, tutorial watching, and hands-on practice. The journey of creating this website has been an exciting one, and I'm thrilled to share it as proof of my dedication and learning.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This website is structured across four HTML pages:
1. **index.html** ‚Äì Home Page
2. **about.html** ‚Äì About Me
3. **projects.html** ‚Äì Projects
4. **contact.html** ‚Äì Contact

The styling is done through four distinct CSS files:
1. **styles.css** ‚Äì The backbone of the homepage and overall site styling.
2. **style2.css** ‚Äì Customizes the **About Me** page.
3. **style3.css** ‚Äì Tailored for the **Projects** page.
4. **style4.css** ‚Äì Styling magic for the **Contact** page.

The interactive elements of the homepage, particularly the **slider**, are powered by the **JavaScript** file:
1. **hi.js** ‚Äì Manages the slider's dynamic movement and ensures smooth interactivity on the index page.
